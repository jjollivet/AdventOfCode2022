Welcome!
Feel free to check out my answers to the Advent of Code 2022 Challenge. I still have much to learn in Python, specifically surrounding coding principles and making use of the large selection of libraries. Furthermore, I tend to side with readability rather than compactness. As a result, these may not be the most efficient solutions, but I hope you can learn something. Thanks for visiting!
